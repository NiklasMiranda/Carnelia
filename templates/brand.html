                Today, to achieve lingerieâ€™s main purpose, a change is needed. At Carnelia, we call this change Modern Lingerie. This means fighting unrealistic beauty standards, unhealthy body images, and predetermined notions of femininity by returning to the true subject: the female body.

            <p class="animated-text">Our first collection, The Four Seasons consists of 4 sets: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. The idea behind the collection came from the similarities between the changes of the body and the changes of the seasons.</p>
