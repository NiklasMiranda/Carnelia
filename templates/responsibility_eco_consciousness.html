                <p>
                    We do so by using certified, recycled fabrics, designing aesthetically sustainable, and sourcing our materials in the near vicinity of our manufacturer.
                    All of our production and sourcing is in Italy, thus reducing our Co2 emissions of transport and also ensuring high-quality and ethical production.
